üåü Project Title:

Flicked Fashion AI - Detect, Match & Classify Fashion in Reels

üìö Overview:

This project is a smart fashion analysis pipeline that takes Instagram-style reels (short videos), detects fashion products worn by people in the video frames, and:

Matches them with a provided product catalog using CLIP + FAISS.

Classifies the overall vibe of the outfit.

Outputs per-video structured JSON data containing the matched product information and vibes.

üí° Key Features:

YOLOv8n for product detection from each frame.

CLIP (ViT-B/32) for embedding both catalog images and cropped products.

FAISS to find exact/similar matches from the catalog.

NLP-based Vibe Classifier that assigns relevant fashion aesthetics (e.g., "Y2K", "Clean Girl", etc.).

Structured per-reel outputs.

üîÑ Pipeline Steps:

1. Frame Extraction:

Videos are placed in /videos/reel/

Frames are extracted using OpenCV (1 frame per second).

2. Fashion Product Detection:

YOLOv8n model (models/yolov8n.pt) detects items like tops, trousers, dresses.

Detected bounding boxes are cropped and saved in flickd_ai_project/data/cropped_items.

3. Catalog Embedding:

Product catalog (from catalog.csv) is processed.

Images are downloaded from URLs.

CLIP encodes them into 512-d embeddings.

FAISS index (catalog.index) + metadata (catalog_metadata.pkl) saved in data/catalog/.

4. Matching Cropped Items:

Each cropped frame is passed through CLIP.

Compared to the catalog using FAISS.

Top-1 result selected if similarity > 0.75.

Output saved in match_results.json.

5. Per-Video JSON Output:

Items are grouped by reel.

Output saved as /outputs/reel_XXX.json.

Each contains:

6. Vibe Classification:

Keywords are extracted from title + description + tags.

Matched to vibe keywords in vibes_list.json.
